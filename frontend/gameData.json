It is the second installment in the Mass Effect series and a sequel to the original Mass Effect. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century, where humanity is threatened by an insectoid alien race known as the Collectors. The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must assemble and gain the loyalty of a diverse team to stop the Collectors in a suicide mission. Using a completed saved game of its predecessor, the player can impact the game's story in numerous ways. For the game, BioWare changed several gameplay elements and further emphasized third-person shooter aspects, including limited ammunition and regenerable health. In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, the developers opted to create a plot where optional missions had as much intensity as the main mission.",

Players take the role of a character who inherits their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as 'Stardew Valley'. Stardew Valley is an open-ended game where players manage a farm by clearing land, growing seasonal crops, and raising animals. Players can build skills in farming, foraging, fishing, mining, and combat. The game also includes social features, such as building relationships with townspeople, with the option to marry and have children. A later update added multiplayer, allowing online play with others. Barone developed Stardew Valley by himself for over four and a half years. He was heavily inspired by the Story of Seasons series, with additions to address some of those games' shortcomings. The game starts with the player character leaving their corporate job to manage a farm just outside of Pelican Town, a town in the eponymous Stardew Valley. The main objective is to restore the farm of the player's deceased grandfather and assist in the town’s revival by completing bundles of goods to help restore the Community Center.",
